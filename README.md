   ## Challenges
   During the project, I had issues with render configurations for the build and deployment process. Otherwise, refactoring the existing RESTful API project to GraphQL and Apollo Server was challenging.
   

   ## Tests
   Ensure the app opens and ensure you are able to navigate into each of the pages as detailed in the usage. You may refer to the above screenshots too.

   ## Future Implementation
   Integrate with online book stores so users could buy them using the link.
